# Finance Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of financial data using Python. It utilizes the `pandas_datareader` library to obtain financial data for several major banks, including Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

## Data Retrieval

The project begins by retrieving financial data for the specified banks using the `pandas_datareader` library. The data spans from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2016, and includes key metrics like the opening price, closing price, high and low prices, and trading volume.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the bank stocks. Key findings and analyses include:

- Identifying the maximum closing prices for each bank.
- Calculating daily returns for each bank's stock.
- Determining the worst single-day stock price drops.
- Identifying the best single-day stock price gains.
- Analyzing the risk profiles of the banks.
- Visualizing the distribution of returns for specific time periods.

## Visualization

The project uses `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for data visualization. Key visualizations include:

- Line plots to show stock prices for each bank.
- Line plots for the moving averages of bank stocks during 2008.
- Distribution plots to illustrate the return distributions of selected banks.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries, including `pandas`, `pandas_datareader`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.

Enjoy exploring the financial data and analyzing the performance of major banks!
